==Version 1.0.2==
Version 1.0.2 released March 2, 2013 - 
OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) compatibility. The old version is still available in case you need it, since I haven't tested the new version of EarthSurfer on old versions of OS X.

==Version 0.6.0==
Version 0.6.0 released Jan 14, 2009 - 

If the Google Earth Browser Plugin is not installed, this version makes a feeble attempt to guide the user through fetching it.

This version was intended to be compatible with PowerPC and with OS X 10.4.11, but I'm informed I still have more work to do. Check back next week for a new version.
