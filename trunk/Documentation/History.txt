- T.U.'s http://www.corp.google.com/~tulrich/surfer/
  - grabbed T.U.'s latest. merged, so we have buildings now.
- my attempt to get the program to run reasonably when bluetooth was off caused it to not connect at all when bluetooth is on. Fixed in :0.8.0


TODO:

- T.U's surfer figure is
  1) Wooden. It is a shame we can't animate him
  2) Big: causes word balloons to come not from his head.
- Add "Jump" to the motion model.
  - a jump: given an average weight over the last second, a jump is a reduction to below 10% for a time, a weight that is > min(1*5*average, max for device) for a short period of time, followed by revert to average.
  - (check with my DarwiinRemote).
- Add battery level indicator.
  - create "control"
  - wire it up.
- Check the DarwiinRemote site: are their Balance Board drivers better than mine?
